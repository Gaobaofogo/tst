# TST

TST is a set of command line tools to automate testing and
verification of programming exercises. TST supports both
input/output and script based tests. While TST is primarily
focused on python programming, it has been successfully used with
Java and Javascript (node.js) programming assignments.

TST command line tools also help the creation of programming
exercises that can be deployed to the web.
